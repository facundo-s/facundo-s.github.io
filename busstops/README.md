<h2>Real Time Bus Tracker</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
In this project I demonstrate the path that a bus takes between MIT and Harvard using the MapBoxGL API. The purpose of this exercise was to get familiar with writing code that interacts with a third pary API, generating an access token and leveraging third party libraries to achieve more advanced web experiences.
</p>
<p>
  Future iterations of this project would keep a list of bus lines that the user could choose from and each would have their respective animation.
