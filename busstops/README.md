<h2>Real Time Bus Tracker</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
In this project I demonstrate the path that a bus takes between MIT and Harvard. Future iterations of this project might include pulling data from different bus routes and allowing the user to chose which bus route they'd like to see the path of. This project is Licensed by the MIT License.
