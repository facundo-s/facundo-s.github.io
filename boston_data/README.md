<h2>Boston and Chicago data manipulation exercises</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The purpose of this exercise was to manipulate data in Javascript. I play around with different sorting algorithms as well as map and reduce to come up with different insights from the data. 

As of today there are two data sets that I played around with. The first was the salary data for all public employees of the city of Boston and the second dataset is the grafitti chrime reports in th city of Chicago.
