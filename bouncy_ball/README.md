<h2>Bouncy Ball animation</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
Here is a demo for a simple animation that simulates a frictionless surface with three balls sliding following Newton's Laws. The purpose of the exercise was for me to practice writing functions in javascript that manipulate elements in the DOM. 

On a second iteration of the project I created functions that created n number of balls with random sizes and direction vectors with speeds inversely proportional to their size.
