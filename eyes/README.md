<h2>Eye movement animation</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
In this exercise I created a browser animation that tracks the motion of the mouse as it's moved around the screen. It uses Javascript to dynamically change the position of div elements, creating the effect of animal eyes following the mouse around.
