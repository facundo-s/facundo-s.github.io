<h2>PacMan animation</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
In this project I explored programmatically creating pacmen objects in the browser and storing them in a virtual DOM to keep track of their movement. The purpose of this exercise was to practice manipulating the DOM in Javascript, simulating motion using timers, maintaining state and setting screen boundaries. 
</p>
<p>
  Future iterations of this project would make the pacmen open and close their mouths using the various images in the images folder.

<h3>How to run</h3>
<p>
  The animation contains two files and a folder which are:
  <ul>
    <li> pacman.js : contains the logic and virtual DOM for the animation.
      <li> index.html : this is the DOM that gets rendered
        <li> images : the assets which are rendered in index.html for the sake of the animation.
    </ul>
  There are two ways you can go about running this project: on your local machine or hosted on this repository's githubpages. To run it on your local machine clone this repo via a git clone or fork. Once in your machine you can open the index.html file which will contain the animation. Alternatively you can visit this repo's github pages site here: https://facundo-s.github.io/pacman/index.html
