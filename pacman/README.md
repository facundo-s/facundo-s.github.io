<h2>PacMan animation</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
Here is a demo for a simple animation that simulates PacMan's motion back and forth on the screen. The purpose of the exercise was for me to practice writing functions in javascript that manipulate img elements in the DOM.

<h3>How to run</h3>
<p>
  The animation contains two files and a folder which are:
  <ul>
    <li> pacman.js : contains the logic and virtual DOM for the animation.
      <li> index.html : this is the DOM that gets rendered
        <li> images : the assets which are rendered in index.html for the sake of the animation.
    </ul>
  There are two ways you can go about running this project: on your local machine or hosted on this repository's githubpages. To run it on your local machine clone this repo via a git clone or fork. Once in your machine you can open the index.html file which will contain the animation. Alternatively you can visit this repo's github pages site here: https://facundo-s.github.io/pacman/index.html
